Within the CollectionBuilder framework, the "Women Letterpress Printers in the West, 1850-1950" project documents women printers (hand press and/or reproductive printmaking) working in the Western world between 1850 and 1950 supported by traditional bibliographic, book historical, and literary studies scholarship. The project represents the geographic locations of identified women printers through digital mapping, as well as materials under women printer/artists’ imprints that are located in libraries, archives, and museums. Undertaking creation of an initial full dataset with complete metadata for forty women printers, other women printers identified during the duration of the project will also be included in the dataset with basic information (name, location with longitude and latitude, and dates) for the geographical map. The project aims to make information more accessible about  women’s contributions to book history, printing history, and cultural studies, aligning with current trends that place bibliographical studies within a feminist lens.
